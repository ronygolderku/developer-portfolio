            <h3> Become an Oceanographer</h3>
            <p>An oceanographer is a special kind of scientist who studies the ocean. The oceans are a

                environment, and so the science of oceanography must be just as large. Oceanographers study every
                different aspect of the ocean, such as the chemistry of the of ocean water, the geology associated with
                the ocean, the physical movements of the ocean water, or even the life that calls the ocean its home</p>
